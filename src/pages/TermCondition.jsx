                  Traveling is fun. It is rejuvenating and the most satisfying
                  experience that anyone can do. When deciding to travel, the
                  most crucial investment a person can make is travel insurance.
                  It provides a valuable protection for both domestic and
                  international travel. At First-Flight.com.au, believe that
                  travel insurance is one of the most important requirements and
                  strongly recommend that our customers take advantage of it to
                  safeguard them selves against unforeseen risks. Adequate
                  travel insurance is a requirement outlined in your contract
                  with us, our partners, collaborators, and third parties. We
                  urge you to carefully review and understand the details to
                  ensure that your insurance covers all the risks and potential
                  losses.

                  arrangements. In such a situation, passengers must contact us,
                  the airline, or the concerned transport suppliers immediately.
                  For passengers who experience flight delays, airlines should
                  solve the problems and make alternative travel arrangements
                  for them as soon as possible for impacted passengers. They
                  also take the initiative to provide additional services to

                  passenger rights will be published at the airports and
                  available to airlines. If in any case, the airline does not
                  comply with rules, the passengers have the right to complain
                  to the Civil Aviation Authority. Reimbursement in such cases
                  is the responsibility of the airline, not the travel
                  companies. A delay or cancellation of the flight does not

                  necessary terms and conditions. For many airlines, a ticket is
                  only valid for travel from the departure airport to the final
                  destination airport including any stopovers in the agreed
                  sequence. In the case of “No-Show”, if a passenger doesn’t
                  travel on their outbound flight despite having a confirmed
                  booking, all other connecting or return flights associated
                  with the booking will be automatically cancelled resulting in
                  a cancellation charge of up to 100%.

                  If the customers do not intend to check in for any part of the
                  confirmed flight they had booked, they need to contact us
                  immediately and notify us to avoid such a situation. A
                  “No-Show” could happen due to several unexpected reasons. It
                  may occur due to unforeseen situations such as traffic jams,
                  vehicle breakdowns, or sickness that causes delays in
                  reporting at the airport. We always encourage passengers to
                  arrive at the airport and check-in with ample time. If
                  passengers want to change their plans, they contact them
                  immediately to discuss various options. At
                  First-Flight.com.au, we hold no responsibility for any loss,
                  damage, or fee imposed due to “No-Shows”.
